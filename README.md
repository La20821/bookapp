# Project 2 - A Need to Read: A Reader's Guide (Book Application)
## Initial Purpose
The purpose of this application is to allow readers to create accounts and use them to keep track of books they've read along with books they want to read. Readers can add books to site's library and mark them as neccessary. Readers can have the ability to search for books by genre or by author. Reading is so important and people read for many reasons. Aside from it keeping our minds fresh and intact, reading can be entertaining and pleasurable. Various novels can make us laugh, cry, or even provide us with educational lessons and tips to apply to our everyday lives. Whatever your reason for reading, you can use this app to help you organize.

### Collaboration
Although this is an individual project, it will be neccessary in this industry to be able to effetively work collaboratively. It may be often that you need to either search for answers or allow your more expierenced peers to share their knowledge. Prior to beginning my project, I discussed with my instructor my ideas regarding the project set up. It was expressed the importance of building a solid project foundation to build from. That foundation includes a clearly struct ER diagram, straightforward user stories, and a created repository with readme file.
