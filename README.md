# Project 2 - Book Application
## Initial Purpose
The purpose of this application is to allow readers to create accounts and use them to keep track of books they've read along with books they want to read. Readers can add books to library and mark them as neccessary. Readers can have the ability to search for books by genre or by author. Reading is so important and people read for many reasons. Aside from it keeping our minds fresh and intact, reading can be entertaining. Various novels can make us laugh, cry, or even provide us with tips to apply to our everyday lives. Whatever your reason for reading, you can use this app to help you organize.
